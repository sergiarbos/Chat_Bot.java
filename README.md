This ChatBot in Java is an interactive application that allows users to have a conversation with a virtual assistant. 
Depending on the implemented version, the bot can respond with predefined answers or use artificial intelligence via the OpenAI API (GPT-3.5/GPT-4) to generate more advanced responses.

Key Features:
✅ Interactive conversation: Users can type messages and receive real-time responses.
✅ Intelligent responses: If using the OpenAI API, the bot generates contextual and natural replies.
✅ Customizable: New responses and behaviors can be added easily.
✅ Developed with Java and Maven: Uses Maven to manage dependencies like OpenAI.How It Works:
